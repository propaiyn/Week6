What if you had a class that needed to extend functionality from more than one place?

Java doesn't allow for the use of multiple superclasses - only one is allowed.


However, we can still accomplish abstraction with interfaces:

they are completely abstract by design (no methods in an interface have bodies)
you can implement multiple interfaces
