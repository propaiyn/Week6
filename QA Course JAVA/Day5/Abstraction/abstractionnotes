 Abstraction = you should hide the implementation details between modules, and only share essential functionality.
i.e. Don't need to show the implementation details to every class or method.

    can use the abstract class or method
        abstract classes cannot be instantiated (no objects ) BUT can be inherited from
        abstract methods (can only exits in abstract classes and haver no methods which are implemented in subclasses

if abstract methods, class itself needs to be abstract (Empty method)
    can included normal methods as well
    hides certain details from user and only shows what is needed
